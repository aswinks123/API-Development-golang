# Login form API using Go

# üìå Overview

This is a user authentication API built in Go. 
It allows users to register, log in, and manage their sessions using cookies. 
The project uses an in-memory map to store user data and bcrypt for secure password hashing.

# üöÄ Features

User Registration: Register a new user with a username and password.

User Login: Log in with a username and password to receive a session cookie.

Session Management: Uses cookies to manage user sessions.

Secure Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.

# Dependencies

golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt: For secure password hashing.

net/http: For handling HTTP requests and responses.

sync: For concurrency safety using mutexes.

# Security Considerations

Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, which is resistant to brute-force attacks.

Session Cookies: Cookies are set with the HttpOnly and Secure flags for added security.

Concurrency Safety: A mutex is used to ensure safe access to the in-memory user store.

# Limitations

In-Memory Storage: User data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts. For production, use a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

No Logout Mechanism: The current implementation does not include a logout feature. You can clear the session cookie on the client side to log out.

No Rate Limiting: The API does not implement rate limiting, which could make it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

# üìú License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License. Feel free to modify and use it as needed.

üí° Future Enhancements

Add a logout endpoint to clear the session cookie.

Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Use a database for persistent user storage.

Add input validation for usernames and passwords (e.g., minimum length, allowed characters).
